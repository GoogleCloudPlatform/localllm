## Running as a [Cloud Workstation][cw]

This repository includes a [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) that can be used to create a [custom base image][cw-custom] 
for a Cloud Workstation environment that includes the `llm` tool.

To get started, you'll need to have a [GCP Project][gcp] and have the `gcloud` CLI [installed][gcloud].

1. Set environment variables
   1. Set the `PROJECT_ID` and `PROJECT_NUM` environment variables from your GCP project. You must modify the values.
       ```shell
       export PROJECT_ID=<project-id>
       export PROJECT_NUM=<project-num>
       ```
   
   1. Set other needed environment variables. You can modify the values.
       ```shell
       export REGION=us-central1
       export LOCALLLM_REGISTRY=localllm-registry
       export LOCALLLM_IMAGE_NAME=localllm
       export LOCALLLM_CLUSTER=localllm-cluster
       export LOCALLLM_WORKSTATION=localllm-workstation
       export LOCALLLM_PORT=8000
       ```

1. Set the default project.
    ```shell
    gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID
    ```

1. Enable needed services.
    ```shell
    gcloud services enable \
      cloudbuild.googleapis.com \
      workstations.googleapis.com \
      container.googleapis.com \
      containeranalysis.googleapis.com \
      containerscanning.googleapis.com \
      artifactregistry.googleapis.com
    ```

1. Create an Artifact Registry repository for docker images.
    ```shell
    gcloud artifacts repositories create $LOCALLLM_REGISTRY \
      --location=$REGION \
      --repository-format=docker
    ```

1. Build and push the image to Artifact Registry using Cloud Build. Details are in [cloudbuild.yaml](cloudbuild.yaml).
    ```shell
    gcloud builds submit . \
        --substitutions=_IMAGE_REGISTRY=$LOCALLLM_REGISTRY,_IMAGE_NAME=$LOCALLLM_IMAGE_NAME
    ```

1. Configure a Cloud Workstation cluster.

   **Wait for this to complete before moving forward** which can take
   [up to 20 minutes](https://cloud.google.com/workstations/docs/create-cluster#workstation-cluster).
    ```shell
    gcloud workstations clusters create $LOCALLLM_CLUSTER \
      --region=$REGION
    ```

1. Create a Cloud Workstation configuration. We suggest using a machine type of e2-standard-32 which has 32 vCPU, 16
   core and 128 GB memory.
    ```shell
    gcloud beta workstations configs create $LOCALLLM_WORKSTATION \
    --region=$REGION \
    --cluster=$LOCALLLM_CLUSTER \
    --machine-type=e2-standard-32 \
    --container-custom-image=us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/${PROJECT_ID}/${LOCALLLM_REGISTRY}/${LOCALLLM_IMAGE_NAME}:latest
    ```

1. Create a Cloud Workstation.
    ```shell
    gcloud workstations create $LOCALLLM_WORKSTATION \
    --cluster=$LOCALLLM_CLUSTER \
    --config=$LOCALLLM_WORKSTATION \
    --region=$REGION
    ```

1. Grant access to the default Cloud Workstation service account.
    ```shell
    gcloud artifacts repositories add-iam-policy-binding $LOCALLLM_REGISTRY \
      --location=$REGION \
      --member=serviceAccount:service-$PROJECT_NUM@gcp-sa-workstationsvm.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
      --role=roles/artifactregistry.reader
    ```

1. Start the workstation.
    ```shell
    gcloud workstations start $LOCALLLM_WORKSTATION \
      --cluster=$LOCALLLM_CLUSTER \
      --config=$LOCALLLM_WORKSTATION \
      --region=$REGION
    ```

1. Connect to the workstation using ssh. Alternatively, you can connect to the workstation
   [interactively][launch-workstation] in the browser.
    ```bash
    gcloud workstations ssh $LOCALLLM_WORKSTATION \
      --cluster=$LOCALLLM_CLUSTER \
      --config=$LOCALLLM_WORKSTATION \
      --region=$REGION
    ```

1. Start serving the default model from the repo.
    ```shell
    local-llm run TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-Ensemble-v5-GGUF $LOCALLLM_PORT
    ```

1. Get the hostname of the workstation using:
    ```bash
    gcloud workstations describe $LOCALLLM_WORKSTATION \
      --cluster=$LOCALLLM_CLUSTER \
      --config=$LOCALLLM_WORKSTATION \
      --region=$REGION
    ```

1. Interact with the model by visiting the live OpenAPI documentation page: `https://$LOCALLLM_PORT-$LLM_HOSTNAME/docs`.

## local-llm commands

[!NOTE] The command is now `local-llm`, however the original command (`llm`) is supported
inside of the [cloud workstations image](#running-as-a-cloud-workstation).

Assumes that models are downloaded to `~/.cache/huggingface/hub/`. This is the default cache
path used by Hugging Face Hub [library][hf-hub] and only supports `.gguf` files.

If you're using models from TheBloke and you don't specify a filename, we'll attempt to use
the model with 4 bit medium quantization, or you can specify a filename explicitly.

1. List downloaded models.
    ```shell
    local-llm list
    ```

1. List running models. 
    ```shell
    local-llm ps
    ```

1. Start serving models.

   1. Start serving the default model from the repo. Download if not present.
       ```shell
       local-llm run TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-Ensemble-v5-GGUF 8000
       ```

   1. Start serving a specific model. Download if not present.
       ```shell
       local-llm run TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-Ensemble-v5-GGUF --filename llama-2-13b-ensemble-v5.Q4_K_S.gguf 8000
       ```

1. Stop serving models.

   1. Stop serving all models from the repo.
       ```shell
       local-llm kill TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-Ensemble-v5-GGUF
       ```

   1. Stop serving a specific model.
       ```shell
       local-llm kill TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-Ensemble-v5-GGUF --filename llama-2-13b-ensemble-v5.Q4_K_S.gguf
       ```

1. Download models.

   1. Download the default model from the repo. 
       ```shell
       local-llm pull TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-Ensemble-v5-GGUF
       ```
   1. Download a specific model from the repo.
       ```shell
       local-llm pull TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-Ensemble-v5-GGUF --filename llama-2-13b-ensemble-v5.Q4_K_S.gguf
       ```

1. Remove models.

   1. Remove all models downloaded from the repo.
       ```shell
       local-llm rm TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-Ensemble-v5-GGUF
       ```

   1. Remove a specific model from the repo.
       ```shell
       local-llm rm TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-Ensemble-v5-GGUF --filename llama-2-13b-ensemble-v5.Q4_K_S.gguf
       ```

## Running locally

1. Install the tools.
    ```shell
    # Install the tools
    pip3 install openai
    pip3 install ./local-llm/.
    ```

1. Download and run a model.
    ```shell
    local-llm run TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-Ensemble-v5-GGUF 8000
    ```

1. Try out a query. The default query is for a haiku about cats.
    ```shell
    python3 querylocal.py
    ```

1. Interact with the Open API interface via the `/docs` extension. For the above, visit http://localhost:8000/docs.

## Debugging

To assist with debugging, you can configure model startup to write logs to a log file by providing a yaml
python logging configuration file:

```
local-llm run TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-Ensemble-v5-GGUF 8000 --log-config <some config file>
```

To run locally using the bundled log config
([log_config.yaml](../local-llm/log_config.yaml)):

```
sudo touch /var/log/local-llm.log
sudo chown user:user /var/log/local-llm.log # use your user and group

# provide the log config manually
local-llm run TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-Ensemble-v5-GGUF 8000 --log-config local-llm/log_config.yaml

# or use an environment variable so you don't have to pass the argument
export LOG_CONFIG=$(pip show local-llm | grep Location | awk '{print $2}')/log_config.yaml
local-llm run TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-Ensemble-v5-GGUF 8000
```

You can follow the logs with:

```
tail -f /var/log/local-llm.log
```

If you are running multiple models, the logs from each will be written to the same file and interleaved.

If running from Cloud Workstations, logs from running models will be written to `/var/log/local-llm.log`
([log_config.yaml](../local-llm/log_config.yaml) is provided by default via the environment variable
`LOG_CONFIG` within the image).
